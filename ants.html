        <p>In the "Ants vs. Bees" project, I began an exciting journey to create a computer game that simulates a battle between an ant colony and invading bees. As the architect of this digital world, I played the role of an ant queen, strategizing to defend the colony against the bees. My challenge was to carefully select various ant types, each with unique abilities, to fortify the colony's defenses. The game's dynamics were intense, with bees advancing through the colony, attempting to invade and destroy the QueenAnt. Echoing the popular "Plants vs. Zombies," this game blends strategy and humor in a similar yet unique setting. Victory hinged on outmaneuvering the bees, a task that became increasingly complex with each level. My role extended beyond gameplay; I delved deep into object-oriented programming, weaving the game's fabric with core classes such as GameState, Place, Hive, AntHomeBase, Insect, Ant, and Bee. I meticulously crafted diverse ant types like HarvesterAnts and ThrowerAnts, and designed a robust system for bees to navigate the tunnels and engage in combat. Critical to the game's success was my ability to balance elements like health, food resources, and turn sequences, ensuring a seamless and challenging gaming experience. This project was a testament to my skills in game design, problem-solving, and translating complex concepts into an immersive, fully functional game.
